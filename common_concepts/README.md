- Variable are defined by the _let_ keyword
- By default variables are immutable
- If program does not compile the program is simply not safe enough
- Add _mut_ designate future readers of the code that this variable will be changed on a later place
- Constants are defined by using _const_ keyword
- Constants are not allowed to be mutable, they are always immutable
- the type of the value must be annotated
- Constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could be computed at runtime
- __Shadowing__ is when a new variable is declared with the same name as a previous variable
- Shawdowing is different from marking a variable as _mut_ because we get a compile time error if we try to reassign to this variable without using _let_
- Shawdowing allows to change the type of the value but reuse the same name of the variable
- Variables cannot change their type
